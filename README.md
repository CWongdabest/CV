## Canace Wong

I am a full-stack software developer in training with Makers Academy, Europe’s leading developer bootcamp. Before joining Makers, I worked in financial and corporate communications, starting my career at an award winning city PR firm for growth companies, where I left as associate partner to assume the role of Head of Communications at a London and Hong Kong based VC firm.  

In my native Hong Kong, I have worked across a range of media organisations, including as South Asia correspondent for Euromoney Institutional Investor, and a short stint at South China Morning Post news and city desks.  

I will be available for work as a developer in January 2018.  I look forward to  bringing your organisation the industry best practice I acquired at Makers, alongside my client service capability, cross-cultural sensitivities, and commercial exposure towards growth companies, developed throughout my career.
